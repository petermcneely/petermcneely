# Peter McNeely's Personal Website
----

This is the source code for my personal website, [petermcneely.com](http://petermcneely.com).

The site is currently written with [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org) and is hosted on [heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com).
I don't envision this site being particularly heavy or in need of a very robust backend. So, I am re-writing it using [angular](http://www.angularjs.org) integrated with [firebase](http://www.firebase.com).
Stay tuned for that roll out!
